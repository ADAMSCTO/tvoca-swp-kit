1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Father, I cast my cares on You, knowing You care for me.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,000
Steady my thoughts and quiet my heart in Your presence.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Teach me to trust Your timing and Your faithful love.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,000
Anchor me in Your peace as I wait on You.
