1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,500
Prayer for success

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,850
All the earth will worship You and sing to Your name.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,200
God, Your way is perfect; Your Word is proven.

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,550
The sea is Yours; Your hands formed the dry land.

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,900
Yahweh Sabaoth—Lord of Armies—You reign.

6
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,250
Lord of mercy, to You belongs forgiveness.

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,600
I confess my intentional and unintentional sins; I’ve strayed in word and deed.

8
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,950
Let me forsake my way and return to You—abundantly pardon me.

9
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,300
Restore to me the joy of Your salvation and uphold me with a willing spirit.

10
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,650
Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the 
majesty!

11
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,1000
Thank You for life, for daily bread, and for salvation— no condemnation for 
those in Christ Jesus.

12
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,350
In weakness, let Your grace be sufficient and Your power made perfect.

13
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,700
Sovereign Lord, teach me to seek first Your Kingdom and righteousness.

14
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,050
I bring my condition before You: help me live in my work and calling.

15
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,400
Grant diligence, wisdom, and favor to all seeking success honorably.

16
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,750
Train me to measure success by faithfulness to You, not worldly gain.

17
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,100
Father, I commit my plans to You.

18
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,450
Not my will, but Yours be done.

19
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,800
In Jesus’ name, Amen.
