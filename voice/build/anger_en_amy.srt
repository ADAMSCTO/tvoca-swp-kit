00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,500
Father, I cast my cares on You, knowing You care for me.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,850
Steady my thoughts and quiet my heart in Your presence.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Teach me to trust Your timing and Your faithful love.

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,550
Anchor me in Your peace as I wait on You.
