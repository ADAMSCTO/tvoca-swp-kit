1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,500
Prayer for anxiety.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,850
Great is Yahweh, worthy of all praise—merciful and gracious, slow to anger, rich 
in love and truth.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,200
The heavens declare Your glory; You made the heavens and the earth. I adore You, 
Elohim.

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,550
Faithful God, I confess my sins—intentional and unintentional. I’ve forgotten 
Your grace.

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,900
Search me, know my heart, and renew a steadfast spirit in me.

6
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,250
With thanksgiving I enter Your courts. Thank You for life and daily bread, and 
for salvation in Christ, who loved us and died for us.

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,600
Even in trials, teach me to count it joy and grow endurance.

8
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,950
Sovereign Lord, nothing is hidden from You.

9
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,300
Jesus, You invite the weary to find rest.

10
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,650
I bring my anxiety and this condition—(state it)—under Your gentle yoke.

11
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,1000
Guard my mind, guide my steps, and make Your Word my steady rhythm.

12
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,350
Open support for all who are under heavy pressure.

13
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,700
I commit my plans to You. I release control—Your will be done.

14
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,050
In Jesus’ name, Amen.
